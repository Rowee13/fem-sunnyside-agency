## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Highlighting some code solution I search to solve the challenge.

Used this to have a scrolling effect in the section navigation

```css
* {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
```

This is for the arrow style in the dropdown menu, using tailwind CSS. Although the output is not 100% matched in the original design.

```html
<div
  className="absolute right-0 top-[-40px] w-10 h-10 border-t-[40px] border-t-transparent border-r-[40px] border-r-white "
/>
```

### Useful resources

- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) - This can provide icons without adding svg or images in your assets folder
